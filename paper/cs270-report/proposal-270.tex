\maketitle

For my project, I will study the algorithmic Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL).  I will begin with a survey of the literature on the subject.  This will cover the nonconstructive lemma due to Erdos and Lovasz \cite{erdos1975problems} (briefly, since it was covered in class), then the first algorithm by Beck \cite{beck1991algorithmic}, and finally the general algorithm and information-theoretic proof by Moser and Tardos \cite{moser2010constructive}.

After the survey, I will (time permitting) explore two questions that motivate my interest in this subject:

\subsection{Connections to MCMC Sampling}
In a 2010 paper, Freer et al \cite{freer2010probabilistic} point out that Moser's algorithm is similar to MCMC sampling in probabilistic graphical models.  In the usual algorithmic LLL setup, we let $\mathcal{E} = \{E_1, \cdots, E_n\}$ be a set of events determined by marginally mutually independent random variables $\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, \cdots, A_m\}$.  We could think of this as a directed probabilistic graphical model (DPGM), with an arrow from each variable $A_i$ to the events $c(A_i)$ dependent on it.  A satisfying assignment is anything that has positive probability when we condition on none of the events happening.  Then Moser's algorithm repeatedly picks parent sets $\pi(E_j)$ that have probability $0$ under the current assignment and resamples them from their marginal distribution.

This is close to a Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme: the proposal distribution resamples all parents of an arbitrary event, and the proposal is rejected if the event already didn't happen under the previous assignment.  Moser's algorithm cannot actually be a proper Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, since the Markov chain produced when we run it eventually reaches an absorbing state.  Still, Srinivasan et al \cite{haeupler2011new} show that Moser's algorithm approximately samples from the ```conditional LLL''' distribution -- the joint distribution of the $A_i$ conditional on none of the events in $\mathcal{E}$ happening -- which is all that we want out of a sampling algorithm.

I would like to investigate whether an algorithm like Moser's could perform fast sampling in PDGMs that satisfy an LLL-like condition.  The proof techniques in \cite{moser2010constructive} and \cite{haeupler2011new} seem quite different from those in the literature on probablistic inference.  For example, the LLL condition applies to graphs with very high treewidth (at least $k$ in the $k$-SAT problem), while exact inference in general graphs is exponentially hard in the treewidth\cite{wainwright2008graphical}.  I also want to see whether Moser's algorithm and proof can be modified to work when the events in $\mathcal{E}$ are merely dependent on the $A_i$, and not fixed deterministically by them.

\subsection{Practicality}
Is Moser's algorithm useful in practice?  It seems that common local search methods for problems like $k$-SAT and graph coloring are similar to Moser's algorithm, but not exactly the same.  Since Moser's algorithm is so simple (and so similar to algorithms like Papadimitriou's algorithm for $2$-SAT \cite{papadimitriou1991selecting}), it seems likely that practitioners would have tried it heuristically.  But I have not (so far) found any studies of this; perhaps this idea has not yet migrated out of the theory community.  So I would like to write a reasonably performant implementation of the parallel version of Moser's algorithm, and then compare it on CSP benchmarks with off-the-shelf solvers and perhaps with an SDP relaxation \cite{steurer2010fast} using an off-the-shelf SDP solver like SeDuMi \cite{polik2007sedumi}.
